Enhance README documentation with improved structure and clarity

**Documentation Improvements:**

- **Added badges** displaying npm version, MIT license, and TypeScript 5.0+ compatibility for quick reference
- **Added table of contents** in a collapsible section for easier navigation through the documentation
- **Expanded installation instructions** with examples for npm, yarn, pnpm, and bun package managers
- **Enhanced Quick Start section** with more descriptive comments explaining the dual-message feature (debug vs user-facing messages)
- **Improved Type Safety section** with clearer explanation of module augmentation and its purpose
- **Added detailed explanations** for error chaining methods (`unwrap()`, `flatten()`, `getTags()`, `getFullContext()`) with inline comments showing what each method returns
- **Added Contributing section** linking to CONTRIBUTING.md guidelines

These changes improve developer onboarding and make the documentation more accessible without affecting any package functionality.
